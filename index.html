                        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. 
                        The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist 
                        Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved 
                        its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam 
                        Adams. Having worked with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick 
                        Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing
                         them to sign with Magenta Records. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the 
                        top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                         and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and
                          coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and 
                          are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring 
                          in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking to
                           be released in late 2021.
